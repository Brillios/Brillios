## 👔 A Bit About Me

- I build robust, scalable, and sometimes even beautiful web apps.
- I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams and making sure everyone actually understands what’s going on.
- I automate the boring stuff (CI/CD, Docker, background tasks) so we can all drink more coffee.
- I’ve worked on everything from cybersecurity tools to data-driven dashboards, with a constant focus on performance and reliability.  
- I’m always learning something new (and probably breaking something in the process).
